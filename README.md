# NACA Airfoil Generator

## Description
The NACA Airfoil Generator is a Python application that allows users to input NACA airfoil parameters (M, P, and T) and visualize the resulting airfoil shape. Users can also save the airfoil coordinates to a CSV file for further analysis or use.
Author: Jesus Torres

## Features
- Generate NACA airfoils with customizable parameters (M, P, T).
- Visualize the airfoil shape in a Matplotlib canvas.
- Save airfoil coordinates to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11.2
- tkinter 
- Pillow (PIL) library for image handling (install with `pip install pillow`)
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage
- Run the application, and the GUI window will appear.
- Enter the NACA parameters M, P, and T in the input fields.
- Click the "Generate Airfoil" button to generate and display the airfoil plot.
- The airfoil plot will be shown in the embedded Matplotlib canvas.
- When you click the "Generate Airfoil" button, the coordinates will be saved to a file named naca_airfoil_coordinates.csv on your desktop.
